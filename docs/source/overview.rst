Overview
========

An open source Python package, for analyzing longitudinal omics  datasets, which includes multiple 
tools for processing of multi-modal mapped data, characterizing time series in terms of periodograms 
and autocorrelations, classifying temporal behavior, visualizing visibility graphs, and testing data 
for gene ontology and pathway enrichment. PyIOmica includes optimized new algorithms adapted 
from MathIOmica (which runs on the proprietary Mathematica platform), now made available as Python 
open source code for all users, and additionally expands extensively graphical utilities for 
visualization of classified temporal data, and network representation of time series.
